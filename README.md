About me
---
Im a Student about to start my computer sience studies.
This is my first bigger solo Project.

As you may be able to see I like to work on the backend, but not that much on the frontend. 
When I'm finished with the first proper version of this website I want to rewrite the frontend to have a better code style and visual consistency. After that I want to add comments and documentation for the backend.

I try to use as little AI as possible. But espacially on the frontend I tend to give in to the temptation or I need to implement or fix something I can't find on the internet myself.

---

If you happen to find this Project I would appreciate your feedback. (Please ignore the caos that is the current frontend)
